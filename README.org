* diophantine-33
An old project I had running on a debian VPS while taking complex analysis (which has nothing to do with the contents of the class, heh). What I wanted to do was find an algorithm that searched the space of all possible solutions to x^3 + y^3 + z^3. Initially I searched all of Z^3, but that became terribly slow terribly quickly. Then I modified the algorithm extensively (and made some changes to allow for serialization, interface changes, and spec'd most of the important functions out) to remove a good 70% of the search space.

My graph theory professor mentioned that it might be easier instead to search the subspace of Z^3 s.t. the cubes formed a weak 3-composition of 0 mod 33 (I elaborate this slightly in TODO.org). This makes the space shrink by a (significant) constant factor, but does not constitute anywhere near a linear time algorithm. I still think about it from time to time, but unless I come across it, there is little reason to update this code.
